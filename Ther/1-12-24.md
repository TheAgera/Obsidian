## First Day of Therapy

My therapist's name is Troy Marks II. I told him about my childhood and the issues I am struggling with. He tells me that I sound confused, and we need to reframe my thinking. My trauma and my thoughts are what shaped my perspective and feelings. I am 21 years old and don't have everything figure out yet. I invalidate myself all the time. The adderall and stim consumption might be an issue.  I am struggling to remember the entire conversation. this should be talked about next week.
