I feel fed up because I just want to be alone and work on myself, but I have people obligiations that I can't seem to get rid of. 
I feel incapable because I cannot make a decision
I feel incompetent and overwhelmed for the same reason above
I feel nervous as I bite my nails all day. I am also nervous because I don't know what is right. 
I feel apprehensive to make any decisions
I feel puzzled while at a home today, like I can't focus on anything. 
I feel resentful because I do not enjoy the people in my life. 
I am fuming due to not knowing what to do, I wish I could just restart with everyone around me, or have never met them. I have never had a person hate me in their life and I don't know how to handle that feeling. 
I feel blue because while I list the reasons above being people oriented, I wish I could enjoy people in my life.
I feel wrong for how I handle my relationships.
I also feel really sorry for how I handle my relationships. I wish I could just own up to what I want but I choose not to.
Finally, I believe I feel I am in high spirits for finally sitting down and working through this sheet.
I feel adrift because I don't know what to do with my time.

1/24/24
I feel isolated because if I do what I want, then I am still left with the problem of not knowing how to make new friends/relationships. So then I feel contentment because it is comfier to stick with what I know
I feel contrite because I know I have done something wrong, and now I can't own up to my mistakes. 
I feel provoked because I feel as though I am doing something I don't want to do, but don't know how to not do it
I feel trapped because I have done things I shouldn't have and am trying to make up for it
I feel confused because I don't have the trust in myself to do what is right
I feel nervous because I don't have the courage to own up to what I want
I feel incompetent because I keep repeating mistakes and patterns of not saying what I want and being truthful to myself and the people around me
I feel empty because I [im not sure]
I feel [WORRIED] because I tend to focus on the negative and that causes me to worry a lot of the time
I feel outcasted because I find it incredibly difficult to meet new people and build relationships while others have developed the skill. It also makes me jealous. I don't know to develop that skill.
I feel appreciative because of the people in my life. They put up with a lot, so I feel I have to owe them something.
I'm not surewhat words I can use to describe this, but touching on the issue last week, I just really don't want to continue this. Its been hard, because I can't tell if I am projecting my problems with life onto Maggie, or Maggie really is the issue. So it causes me to feel alot of what i have listed. My body is telling me to go,  I feel a physical response to LEAVE LEAVE LEAVE RUN AWAY OMG. And its hard, because the thing I am running away from is someone I am so fond of. I am seeing the Maggie today, and it made me so angry I was about to start crying. Fortunately, I have my own office at work, and I was able to close that door and mediate and breath for a few minutes to clam me down. Now I am focusing on not trying to get rild up and ruminate. I have a lot on my plate, and I'm not sure how trying to meet another persons needs is a good idea when I can barely meet my own needs. IF I do decide to break away, I don't want to fall into my old habits of isolating myself and not connecting with myself and others. I haven't been enjoying this process while I am putting in low effort, how is putting in more effort going to make me feel better?????? So, that is my main issue that is bothering me. It is just hard because while we are both laid back, silly people, none of our interests and goals line up, so its one of us compromising all the time, or one of us masking during the conversation. I honestly am amazed we kept this up for so long. I feel really contrite because I went into this just excited to get a girlfriend, but once I realized my girlfriend was an entire person, I realized I bit off more than I can chew and decided to check out mentally. I realize people get divorced, but I don't know how to convince myself that what I am doing is okay besides its what I wanna do. Like if I had to spend every day with them, I would seriously loose my mind. I did spend every day with them for months, and I lost my fucking mind. With everything I am trying to do, I don't think I can have a relationship I enjoy until I get my own place. Once again, I cannot figure out if these are my true feelings, but rather another issue at play
On another note, I tend to feel like I focus mostly on the negative. I think this represents a bigger problem at hand, and not just the things i have mentioned. 
I feel exposed because I act just like my parents, who only care about people until they start inconveniencing their lives, they like me when I am like a cat or a dog.
## 1/25/24

The next day. Yesterday at her house, it was great because we had homework to do so we didn't talk much. She then asked me to stay over friday and saturday because of said homework and while in the moment I said yes, this morning in my car I was just screaming crying because I don't want too.  I realize in a situation like the one I am in, nobody is right, and everybody is right. People will tell you things to make you feel better but neither is right, its just about doing what you want. She wants me to win her back, but if I wasn't enjoying the relationship while I was putting in minimal effort, how am I going to enjoy things putting in more effort? Like I'm the one who changed my mind about you, you win me back.

## 1/26/24

Last night had a conversation with my friend about everything and also read him the 4-Page Essay Maggie wrote explaining her perspective on the relationship. The first time I read that, I felt convinced to re-enter the relationship. However, I think re-reading this a second time showed me that when someone writes something like that, its time to stop "working on things" and go your seperate ways. Live is too short to feel this kinda way for this long. Even if there is a chance of making everything work, I'm just over it at this point. I feel so empty trying to continue this, and I can't see a way in which it stops feeling like a miserable existence. The physical attraction is completly gone. I am also aware of my short comings, and wish I had been more certain in my feelings before entering this relationship, and I wish I hadn't let her on for the last two months, but I really wanted to know if this could work. However, I have just been feeling worse and worse the past two months. She can try and convince me, but in my heart I know this isn't right and I will convince her. I think I am just scared of being alone, but even if this hurts, I need to make the right decision and end this now.
I feel [guilty] because I made this go on for so long 
i feel [alone] because I have to learn to live without a partner
I feel [confused] because I am so scared of making the wrong decision
I feel [puzzled] because I feel in my heart that the decision to end this is the correct one
I feel [awful] because I have to hurt someone so bad. Even though its a three hour conversation at worst and that will be it. Whatever problems and issues I leave is her problem to deal with. I am sorry for the pain I have caused and I recognize my mistakes, but I don't want to do this anymore
I feel [attached] so it makes letting go even harder, but I just know this is the right decision
I feel [optimisitc] because once I get this over with, and can finally focus on myself, I will feel so relieved
I feel [strongly and confidently] that this relationship will not work.
I feel [stumped] on how to justify my decision to Maggie, without just saying I don't want to make this work


Maggie, I don't wish to be here, I don't want to date anymore, and I don't see a future together where we are both happy. I'm sorry for pain I have caused you, I never meant to hurt you. I take full responsibility for what i have done. In my heart, I believe that we just aren't compatible. This last two months have been me trying, but all thats done is hurt you more and made me realize that this relationship is hurting me as well. You are probably angry, and will be sad and confused. However, I think once enough time has passed you will start to realize that I am right. I suggest you don't comb through your memories and try to figure out where it went wrong, this will only make the process more difficult for you. I have no explanation for you that will make you satisfied. I would comb through your memories, and make a list of everything that I did that made you feel bad. Again, in time you will realize that I am right. One day you will wake up and you won't think about me anymore. I don't regret any of the time I spent with, you've taught me so much and I will always think of you fondly. I will not be contacting you, if you need further closure, I can provide that, but besides that this is goodbye. I wish you a beautiful life.

## 1/31/24
I am really struggling to answer my three questions. To be fair, I didn't give my self a day to really process the last two years, what happened, and how I am feeling now. I am kinda of just shoving it all down again....
- ### What Did I Learn From My Relationship
	- I learned so much in my relationship it will be hard to remember it all and explained it all. Currently what I'm thinking is how important it is to be open and honest with the person you with. Nobody is perfect, but the grass is greenest where you water it. Sure, it might be difficult to tell someone that you hate spending all of your time with them and that its not for you, but having those conversations gives you both the ability to work through as a team. I also think having similar goals and values are really important, even with things that might seem "redundant" to others is important to you. If you are on a mission, you want someone who is on a similar mission. You don't need this however, but I think it would help. I learned a lot about what I want my life to look like, and what I really wanna do with my life. I learned how to put someone before me (even for a short time). I learned the importance of love, not romantic, just general love and having a positive mindset towards the people in your life. I learned the importance of taking the time to think and sit with yourself. I learned how to get along with someone I normally wouldn't
- ### How Did I Grow From My Relationship
	- Like the above, I grew so much from my relationship, and I learned so much about myself from Maggie. I grew in the relationship because I was trying to make a human connection. How I grew was that I learned the importance of human connection's. The last two years really made me grow just becuase of how challenging they were. Every aspect of me was challenged and met with someone asking why I did the things I did. I grew because I let someone love me, I wasn't really sure I was deserving a love before I met Maggie, and she showed me I was. 
- ### What Are Three Ways I Did Good
	- I was physically there for my partner. Out of the two years, there were only 2 or 3 times where I wasn't physically present for maggie when she needed me. I also did a lot of physical work for her to make her life easier
	- I learned about what my partner likes, even if they were things I would normally like at judgementally. For example, she was really into astrology, psychology, animals, and how society should be structured. I never really cared about those things but I took the time and effort to learn about them, for her and my own sake. I learned a lot from her
	- Honestly I can't think of anything else I did good in the relationship. Maybe this is just me being hard on my self, in a disgraceful way, but besides that I am not really sure what I did good. All I have to go off where what Maggie said to me when I asked her "what do I do for you" and how even after I broke her heart not once, but twice, she said I can always come back if I change my mind. She said I provided quality time, I was a nice break in her day, she enjoyed talking to me and getting to know me... I am struggling to remember much. I tend to struggle to remember the finer details of things, I wish I was better. For example, I will not remember most of this therapy conversation, and I am not sure if that is me being not present or what
### Extra thoughts
	I delayed the breakup until sunday and broke up on our anniversary, I even told her I loved her that same day and it definitely eats me up a little. It was the hardest thing I had ever done, it was consistent crying for hours on end, and when I got in my car I lost it, and when I got home I lost it some more. I cried a little the next day but I am pretty much okay now. I think it is just now settling in that Ill never see her again. It makes me feel isolated because now it is up to me to develop connections with people and put myself out there more. I also feel puzzled because I am not sure what to do next. I am scared of falling into another partnern of staying in my room 24/7 doing nothing with my life. I know I will die with regrets no matter what, life is a game of trade-offs. 
	During the breakup, Maggie made a lot of good points of how I am going to regret this decision because I am avoidant and this is something we could really work on. She started to make sense to me during this process, however I knew in my heart that if I had listened to her I would have regret the decision. Troy, why did you not bring up being avoidant? I initially regretted my decision and was so confused why you let me leave with my decision made knowing this, however the answer is I would have regretted the decision. 
	I just can't believe she is gone, it is such a shame, I wish we were just friends and never got in a relationship. Maybe in a few years we could have developed a real relationship, but I was excited to get a girlfriend and "explore" I still do so many of her character manerisms.

I feel panicy, and I cannot the answer the because I don't know why, but holy shit I am so panicked, alarmed, so many FEARFUL emotions, FEAR drives me so much and I CAN"T STAND IT
I feel like my life is going to stagnate now and idk what to do

## 2/2/24
So today's visit we talked about my emotions and feelings before the breakup, during, and after.

We also talked about fears, what they mean, and how I should confront them. 

My homework is to think back of memories during elementary school, what was school like, what were the people like, who where the people. Outside of school, what was my home like, how did I feel? Who was there, why were they there? What did I do, what did I like? Friends? Traumatic events?
Who is the Kyler Suess I want to be?
Also continue to think about relationship and remind myself that I did a good job with the information I had, and i did what I want and felt what was best for me.

In elementary school, that would probably be when most of the fighting happened. With that said, my real parents were the television and the videogame. I was given an xbox 360 with Xbox Live and microphone.

When I come to think of my childhood, there isn't much there I can currently feel, so writting down my feelings will be struggle during this. I will begin to write out events and fill out details

*INCLUDE STUFF ABOUT MOTHER*
To start, I have no memories of my Father. I am told he was nice a guy. He didn't say a ton, but what he said was good. Everyone seemed to like him. Its a real shame I never got to meet him. So, I do have memories of it just being my mom, my older sister, and I. I have the memory of meeting my first friend. His name was Jesse and lived at the corner house across the street. I saw him playing outside in his front yard and my mom encourage me to go play with him. I think we were playing hot wheels in the dirt... for some reason? Besides Jesse and soon to be his older brother patrick, I didn't have any other friends. I did have an xbox (original xbox) and I think my older sister had a gamecube or ps2. I don't really have any memories from this point. Apparently there was a lot of different people who came and gone. Some family some friends. Then this guy named Brandon showed up 
As a side note, I really don't remember much of my childhood. I wish I had more memories, it makes me sad. I feel as though I have been distressed and estranged for a really long time I feel like I just wanna cry trying to think about this.
I have more memories once Brandon showed up. I think I remember the first day he came over, my cousin Remy was there (we longer talk), who has about 4 or 5 years on me. I was running around swearing and being chaotic. I wasn't bad persay, just outspoken. He was able to put a stop to that and started to come around. We used to play burnout takedown on the xbox 360, it was nice. 
So the people in my life currently are my mom Stacy, my step-dad? Brandon, my older sister Kayla, my friends Jesse and Patrick, my cousins Remy, Whitney, Alec, and Marissa. There was also my friends mom Kimmy and her Husband Steve (scubba), my cousins mom Rachel. No one my Bio.Fathers side was around. I only know of one Person and his name was Jake, but he is a douche, not terrible but a douche.
There was more people around at the time but I don't much memory of them. Supposedly my GodFather before Brandon showed up a full-blown skinhead who beat a woman to near death behind a bar and threw her body in a dumpster. She was still alive when the police found her. I have no memory of this man. 
My Father before he died started a carpeting business and made good money, so we had a nice 3 bedroom ranch and a pool and my mom had some money. However, my mom was in a spot to be taken advantage of so most people, family and friend, took all of her money. 
Supposedly, once Brandon showed up, alot of the scumbag people left my mom alone because he put a stop to it. However, putting a stop to it meant a lot of fighting...
One when was My mom and Brandon came home out from hanging out Brandon sister and boyfriend. Turns out he knew my dad and so Bethany started saying a bunch of mean stuff to my mom. They come home screaming at each other and flipping over furniture. I was woken up by it and was immeasurably terrified.
Another was during this big party, where it mostly people my Mom's were friends with and Brandon. Things got nasty, but I have one memory of Brandon yelling at this couple to get the fuck out of our house, and this chick has blood running down her face (idk who hit her, Brandon says it wasn't him). She eventually leaves, and I remember the cops being called. There would be many times where I would wake up and no Brandon, or his shit would be all over the front lawn. A lot of the smaller stories I don't really remember. I was so young and so scared that I found it best to just turn off my brain and get through whatever was happening. I'm sure if my older sister was here she would have more stories. She told me one time my mom dragged her outside and made Kayla fight her. Generation cycle jeez. Kayla is pretty funny, she is 5 years older than me, and says that during all of this, she was just angry. I was terrified. Kayla really isn't scared of much it seems and will gladly fight someone. 


My initial thought to this question revolved around the idea that I have people who “look up to me” and I’m someone who can strike a conversation with anyone. These are all because I feel inadequate. The kind of Kyler Suess I want to be starts with being happy. Not a happiness that I achieve because it’s what society expects of me, but doing what makes me truly happy. I realize the vagueness of this, happy what does that mean The kind of Kyler Suess I want to be is the one that experiences life, builds connections with new and familiar people, and doesn’t let life slip them by. I also want to be the kind of Kyler Suess that really loves himself, feels confident, but in a way I deem respectable. I don’t want to become arrogant, I want to become confident. I want to be the one who chases after their dreams, and doesn’t let fear get in the way. Even if some of that is driven by people’s perspective, it’s what I want right now. I yearn for the approval and validation of others My school life during my childhood isn’t much to talk about. I wasn’t there everyday, maybe 4 out of 5 days. I excelled early on because playing nothing but video games meant for mature audiences, forced me to learn the basic comprehension skills you learn in elementary school. I already knew how to read and do math so my life for that period was very easy. I also weirdly felt I was better than everyone at this age, and I think some parts of me feel that o really am to good for some people. I’m not sure where this narcissistic mindset came from, but during this time I would often not interact with people in my class as I felt they were not at my intellectual level, and they were too mature. I chalk this up to most of my online “friends” being older than me. I thought well I’m hanging with the cool kids and you guys aren’t so I’m better? There was one time I hung out with a kid in like 4th grade, however they turned out to be getting into fights and I just kind of distanced myself. At the same time, I can’t help but feel I felt so inferior to these people. From day one I have always been so concerned with how I looked and I was perceived it drove me insane. The fear of just going to school would make me miss so many days. Then once you miss one day, it’s like a snowball rolling down a hill, so the pressure to miss more is even stronger. My mom didn’t really care for getting me ready and making sure I went to school. She had her own issues to deal with, and just sees kids like pets that she shouldn’t have to take care of. I also had acquaintances within my classes but never any long lasting friends. I also felt it was extremely difficult to relate. In 3rd grade, I played football for a year. The anxiety I felt going to practice everyday was so immense, but then I’d go and it would be okay. I think I was just so scared as a child, I felt I couldn’t do anything. Just thinking about how scared I was makes me want to cry, I just can’t believe I have been living my entire life on fear mode. I went onto football fields and played actual games! Although I had no idea what the hell I was doing and I was too scared to ask. I was a linemen so my only thought in my head was push this dude and don’t let him do anything. It was really cool wish I would’ve stuck with it. I think it would have built character. However my mom let me quit after I complained one time the next year. I’ve also always had the nickname Bubba not sure where it came from but I’ve always been Bubba. I guess because I was big?? That’s pretty much it for my time in school. I remember two really big fights that have really left a mark on me. One when was My mom and Brandon came home out from hanging out Brandon sister and boyfriend. Turns out he knew my dad and so Bethany started saying a bunch of mean stuff to my mom. They come home screaming at each other and flipping over furniture. I was woken up by it and was immeasurably terrified. Fortunately I wasn’t hurt Another time was

## 2/11/24

I have not done any reading, I am going to start as I wind down for my bed. However, during this weekend alone I have felt somethings that I should be written, but I am not sure how to interpret them yet.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I feel shackled because of a NSFW addiction. I have been viewing and addicted to this stuff since I was a child, maybe 10 or 11, but we can say 12 to be safe. I stopped at one point in my life for months at a time, and I can say that was when I felt the best. It causes me to lose energy, have a poor mood, and brain fog. Also poor sense of judgement and causes me to waste time. I was really good last week, however I went to this local WWE thing and there was this female wrestler up there and I just thought about her the entire time and once I got home I just let it happen and I don't know why. That then led to me watching it multiple times a day for friday, saturday, and today which is sunday. It's crazy because every time I finish, I go god damnit I fucked up shit shit. Every time I feel an urge I need to get up and walk away. I have turned my home environment (my room) into one where I feel so compelled to view NSFW content. I know there is something in addiction psychology where your behavior is based on your environment, but I am not sure how to fix the behavior without changing the environment. I have felt other things, but I think the path I choose over the last few days, has caused me to snowball this weekend. I wouldn't call it a fail of a weekend, but I definitely messed up and I need to start incorporating strategies into combatting this addiciton. That is not true, the other thing I feel this weekend is a feeling of realization that I express some narcisccist traits. Maybe this is me invalidating myself. I only say this due to my high levels of self independnce, self judgement, and judgement of others.

Today at work, I made a mistake. That mistake is at best, a minor cosmetic defect. That mistake at worst, is $5500 dollars down the drain. d While emotionally, I am upset because I made a mistake, lets take a look at the puzzle and figure out the logical side. This mistake is representative of a bigger pattern of now slowing down, and througholy thinking/reading whatever it is I do. This mistake also represents a lack of memory retention. I am not sure why I started that machine, I made so many assumptions. I guess I wanted to start that machine due to my own ego and felt like I had to do something on my own for once instead of relying on the help of others.

This mistake tells me that I need to start slowing down, looking at the puzzle, and making a plan for step 1, step 2, and step 3.

Moving on to my therapy homework

## 2/16/24

In today's session, we discussed everything I said above. Ultimately, what I need to realize is that 
I made a few human mistakes over the last two weeks.
Part of making lasting changes is consistency and compassion
There are three kinds of coping strategies: distractions, physical, and breathing.
When you are a 10/10 emotion,  using a combination of the three to bring you down can be really helpful
Sitting and thinking about the problem can be difficult for someone who tends to overthink.
