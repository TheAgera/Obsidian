I feel fed up because I just want to be alone and work on myself, but I have people obligiations that I can't seem to get rid of. 
I feel incapable because I cannot make a decision
I feel incompetent and overwhelmed for the same reason above
I feel nervous as I bite my nails all day. I am also nervous because I don't know what is right. 
I feel apprehensive to make any decisions
I feel puzzled while at a home today, like I can't focus on anything. 
I feel resentful because I do not enjoy the people in my life. 
I am fuming due to not knowing what to do, I wish I could just restart with everyone around me, or have never met them. I have never had a person hate me in their life and I don't know how to handle that feeling. 
I feel blue because while I list the reasons above being people oriented, I wish I could enjoy people in my life.
I feel wrong for how I handle my relationships.
I also feel really sorry for how I handle my relationships. I wish I could just own up to what I want but I choose not to.
Finally, I believe I feel I am in high spirits for finally sitting down and working through this sheet.
I feel adrift because I don't know what to do with my time.
