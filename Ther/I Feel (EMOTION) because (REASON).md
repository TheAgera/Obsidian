1/24/24
I feel isolated because if I do what I want, then I am still left with the problem of not knowing how to make new friends/relationships. So then I feel contentment because it is comfier to stick with what I know
I feel contrite because I know I have done something wrong, and now I can't own up to my mistakes. 
I feel provoked because I feel as though I am doing something I don't want to do, but don't know how to not do it
I feel trapped because I have done things I shouldn't have and am trying to make up for it
I feel confused because I don't have the trust in myself to do what is right
I feel nervous because I don't have the courage to own up to what I want
I feel incompetent because I keep repeating mistakes and patterns of not saying what I want and being truthful to myself and the people around me
I feel empty because I [im not sure]
I feel [WORRIED] because I tend to focus on the negative and that causes me to worry a lot of the time
I feel outcasted because I find it incredibly difficult to meet new people and build relationships while others have developed the skill. It also makes me jealous. I don't know to develop that skill.
I feel appreciative because of the people in my life. They put up with a lot, so I feel I have to owe them something.
My next entry reveals a negative side to me, but I feel as though I am helpless in finding another romantic partner, if I felt differently I don't think this breakup would be so difficult
I'm not what words I can use to describe this, but touching on the issue last week, I just really don't want to continue this. Its been hard, because I can't tell if I am projecting my problems with life onto the issue, or the issue really is the issue. So it causes me to feel alot of what i have listed. My body is telling me to go however, I feel a physical response to LEAVE LEAVE LEAVE RUN AWAY OMG. And its hard, because the thing I am running away from is like bambi, and I feel like I am shooting bambi. I am seeing the issue today, and it made me so angry I was about to start crying. Fortunately, I have my own office at work, and I was able to close that door and mediate and breath for a few minutes to clam me down. Now I am focusing on not trying to get rild up and ruminate. I have a lot on my plate, and I'm not sure how trying to meet another persons needs is a good idea when I can barely meet my own needs. IF I do decide to break away, I don't want to fall into my old habits of isolating myself and not connecting with myself and others. I haven't been enjoying this process while I am putting in low effort, how is putting in more effort going to make me feel better?????? So, that is my main issue that is bothering me. It is just hard because while we are both laid back, silly people, none of our interests and goals line up, so its one of us compromising all the time, or one of us masking during the conversation. I honestly am amazed we kept this up for so long. I feel really contrite because I went into this just excited to get a girlfriend, but once I realized my girlfriend was an entire person, I realized I bit off more than I can chew and decided to check out mentally. I realize pople get divorced, but I don't know how to convince myself that what I am doing is okay besides its what I wanna do. Like if I had to spend every day with them, I would seriously loose my mind. I did spend every day with them for months, and I lost my fucking mind. With everything I am trying to do, I don't think I can have a relationship I enjoy until I get my own place.
On another note, I tend to feel like I focus mostly on the negative. I think this represents a bigger problem at hand, and not just the things i have mentioned.
