#### Use Cases
- Security Configuration Assesments (SCA) preset rules found under /var/ossec/ruleset that asses various factors about a system, shows the issue and solution.
- Malware Detection, does not use signature based identifcation, instead does a behavior based detection, so attack techniques are monitored. Will look for multiple fields that denoate indicators of compromise for reducing false positives.
- FIle Integrity Monitoring
- Threat Hunting
