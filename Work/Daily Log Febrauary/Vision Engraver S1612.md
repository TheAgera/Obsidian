### What I have Discovered
- The machine uses its own custom software. You can import many types of files, even .dwg, however those say the plotter is missing.
- The machine can grab DHCP addresses and does show in the manual a section for DHCP usage, not sure if it can route. There is nothing in the manual for routing. 
- There is a way to plot a dwg file and import the plot file, however the dimensions seem to be wrong. This could be due the print page settings. Importing a PDF with an unidentified font causes it to not show
## What I have Discovered about using the software
- When using a fill/hatch, you can turn off the outline color by pressing control and then the color you wish not engrave. This makes it so that the color is not engravable or selectable.
