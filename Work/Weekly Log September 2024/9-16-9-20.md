I want to complete remaining items on AutoCAD Manager so it can be given to one of the engineers on monday. What needs to be done with this:
	- Make seperate page for AutoCAD install and functionality for AutoCAD install
	- Profile migrate https://help.autodesk.com/view/ACDLT/2025/ENU/index.html?guid=GUID-D4502890-6980-4942-8841-7248F4ECA848
	- Review Visual Design 
	- Check error function that runs before errors/crashes are actrually triggered. 


Goals for the day:
- Office Map
		Printer Function, 
- Hang up Door signs 
- Take inventory of what plastic I have
- Office clean up
