I want to complete remaining items on AutoCAD Manager so it can be given to one of the engineers on monday. What needs to be done with this:
	- Make seperate page for AutoCAD install and functionality for AutoCAD install
	- Profile migrate https://help.autodesk.com/view/ACDLT/2025/ENU/index.html?guid=GUID-D4502890-6980-4942-8841-7248F4ECA848
	- Review Visual Design 
	- Check error function that runs before errors/crashes are actrually triggered. 


## 9-23

Door Signs
- How much plastic do I have, what kind of each color

- Known Issues:
	- Visual Errors
		- Page Scaling on top of window scaling (4k screens cause issue)
		- Help Buttons are in a different spot on each page, make a box that page is centered around
		- After ACAD install or library install, istructions to load profile
	- Code Errors:
		- ACAD install: If Versions match, force out of page
		- Profile Migration: Notify user what is happening, , can this work without using the AutoDESK gui?
		- Hard-coded autocad version paths 
		


-- Goals for today, fix ACAD install page back end, trying to add a wait timer to adding support paths. 
 I'm going to need a MODAL to show installation is currently happening, so that way the page is restricted.
	 I am going to take over the ENTIRE window, meaning the MainWindow.XAML, however I need to be able to access the MainWindow elements from the ACAinstall.cs

I have MAIN window override done, need to make progress tracker function.


Need to make a Page template that everything can align to.
