### What do I look for in premarket
- Lows and highs
- Liquidity
- Break of structure
- Where is market going (use your head, is market going to take out the highs and lows )
- Order Blocks
- Our bias is already confirmed because we saw a break of structure on the 15m,
- Market opens, rips up, check to 1m and see it broke structure, however the higher time frame holds more power 
**I get stuck on lower time frames too much. Higher TF holds more power
**I need to really review BREAK of structure and ORder blocks**
