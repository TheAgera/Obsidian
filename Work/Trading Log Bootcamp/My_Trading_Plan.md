My risk is <=1%
I will only take one trade. If I lose a trade but have not risked more than 1%, I can take a trade if I find a very good setup

I will try to take a trade at 8am NY session open, or 9:30 at NYSE open
If I can't find a setup past 10:30 I will not trade


I will not trade news

I am trading Gold, GBP pairs, EURUSD, and USDJPY, SPX rairly

I will enter off of, at the minimum,
Liquidty sweep and break of structure.
FVG and OB are extras, if I can find them the better

I will NOT deviate from my daily bias


My weaknesses right now are orderblocks and break of structure

I think I have a pretty good understanding of liquidity and liquidity sweeps along with
fair value gaps and equilibrium
