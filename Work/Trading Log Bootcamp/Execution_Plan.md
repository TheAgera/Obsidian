#### Building Block
	- Liquidity Sweep (LiqS)
	- Break of Structure (BoS)
	- Order Block (OB)
	- Fair Value Gap (FVG)
	- Equilibrium (EQ)
#### What Do Our Building Blocks Tell Us
	- Liquidity Sweep: Potential For orders to get filled, high or low getting taken out. Not full confirmation.
	- Break of Structure: Confirmation orders were filled and we see a market structure shift. Safe to say orders are filled and direction is changed
	- Order Blocks: Price Range where orders were filled, move up that caused the liquidty shows us where the orders were accumulated
	- Fair Value Gaps: A price range where this is a LACK of liquidity, nobody was going in the opposite direction. Also known as imbalance. NO counter acting orders.
	- Equilibrium: Shows the discounted price between highs and lows
#### How Do the Pieces Give us Entries when Put Together
-  Liquidity Sweep + Break of Structure : Orders had the potential to get filled (off of a high or low) and were confirmed that they were by a BoS. 
- LiqS + BoS + OB: Orders had the potential to get filled and were confirmed that they were by a BoS and we waited for the price range where orders were filled prior to get hit to get an optimal entry. Order blocks are formed off of a break of structure, so instead of taking the trade right away, we wait for price to come back into the order block range.
- LiqS + BOS + FVG: Orders had the potential to get filled and were confirmed that they were by a BOS and we waited for the price range where there was a lack of liquidity in the market in the opposite direction of our bias to get hit for us to enter. The fair value gap represents an area showing lack of liquidity opposite to our current bias. For example, if we were bullish and we see a bullish FVG get filled, it means there is a lack of liquidty in that price. We wait for that price range to get hit and have some kind of reaction.
- LiqS + BOS + FVG/OB + EQ: Orders had the potential to get filled and were confirmed that they were by a BoS and we waited for the price range that has either a OB or FVG along with it being in a discount to enter. This is our full proof plan and highest confluence.
