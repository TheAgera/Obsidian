Like being stuck in a low time frame, I need to avoid being stuck being so sad about having a bad month or week, because if I have a bad week, I still have 3 more weeks, and if I have a bad month, I still have 11 more months to be up on the year. 
Losses are a great time to clear my head.

There's a difference between being alone and being lonely, and the most successful people thrive when they are alone, but those same people are never lonely. Mediation is a good way to practice this skill.

Currently I am lonely because I am not comfortable with being my self. When you aren't surrounded by distractions, you are able to get the most amount of work done. All of the distractions are distracting you from yourself. Stop trying to drown them out with drugs, people, or any type of distractions.

Homework is to learn how to be alone, I need to mediate in my room, no sound, no nothing, and let every thought run through my head, and then I can really understand how much time I am wasting with distractions.

Understanding this value will help me grow so quickly I have no idea.

Most people don't know themselves because all they is mask 24/7, and when you mask 24/7 it is really easy to hate your life. You hate your life because you throw distractions infront of yourself. Are you doing the shit you want to do in life?

As long as I have love myself, then no one can touch because I am true to myself and I know what I believe.
