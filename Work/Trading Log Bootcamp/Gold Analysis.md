## Monthly

Monthly is currently bullish but if we close below 1892, we can be considered bearish

## Weekly

In thte weekly we are currently bearish, there is a large imbalance which we just filled at 1893,
it also puts us in a premium for equilibrium

## Daily

Daily is showing bearish as well, I don't see any of our building blocks, we did sweep a lot of liquidity a few days ago which leads me to believe we are going to retrace up.

## 4HR/1Hr


4HR was bullish until yesterday where we broke structure, but we are on record to break structure again back to the upside. 1HR broke structure back to the upside
