### Today's trade
I decided to take a trade on SPX, price was inside a 30m fair value gap, along with entering london session high. Price broke structure on the 1m and I entered. My trade did hit tp1, then price rallied at market open. Why? THERE WAS A MASSIVE IMBALANCE along with resting liquidity. I decided to stay in the trade which was dumb because I wasn't following my rules. I only made Money today because TJR took a short after the rally because the 1hr high got swept along with other confluences. 

**For the future, I NEED to look at the higher timeframes to find confluences. I am so focused on the session high and low strategy that I completely forget about everything else**

Today I thought gold looked nice, I was able to catch a small short off a 1hr liquidity sweep, break of structure, and orderblock. It hit tp1 and I was stopped at break even. I did good at this point, but then I tried to revenge trade, because I had only risked .5%. I thought my reentry was nice but set my stopless to smalll because I was emotional. Currently I would be up well over a % if I had traded emotionless, and been more patient. I then traded SPX as per TJR reccomendations. The entry was the same as gold, and got tp1 with stop a break even. SPX might run more, but honestly I am okay today as i am up about .4%.
- IF I were to do better, I need to start being more robotic during my trades. and especially after I place the trade. I can't seem to ever look away from the charts. I also need to be patient, as I realize there are about 3 trades you can take between 8am, and 10:30am. So if I be patient I can wait for the perfect setup.

I took a Gold long today, I am currently still in the trade as no TP or SL has been hit. My HTF Bias was long, Everything below the daily was showing a bullish shift in structure. There was a FVG on the daily time frame that I thought price was going to go into, and the send price further down. Price ended up sweeping the weekly liquidity before 8am NYS started. At session start, price immediately fell down, with a small small retracement then consolidate for the rest of the day. Price ended up sweeping london session sell side liquidity and broke structure on 5m and 15m but not higher than that. I entered off of that alone. In hindsight, I should've started at the weekly and noticed weekly liquidty was sweept, meaning we were going to really down a bit. GOLD is bearish and will continue to be bearisdh unless we get a htf break of structure.
- Update, trade ended up working out, it was until before NYSE close that price began to rally. However, i believe that to be luck. Gol

I had a perfect gold short set up today after news, but I was scared to take it. IT was a simple EQ play. My only issue was I was waiting for confirmation off of Equilibrium, when in reality I already have confirmation through the liquidity, break of structure that caused the initial movedown. EQ was just to find a retracement in case you missed the original entry. Overall because I know for next time and I know that in a few years I will be very profitable. Also today was a news day and I really shouldnt have traded anyways.

I took a trade on XAUUSD today. I could've taken two. Weekly was bearish, daily was bearish, but 4hr was bullish. Price was coming down and I initially saw a really good long oppurtinity off of a order block and break of structure. I didn't see a liquidity sweep. That order block pushed price up and did sweep liquidity, and broke structure to the downside. I took this trade because it was in line with my daily bias. However once I was in the trade, I started to get anxious because I wasn't very confident and ended up entering too early, and exiting too early. I am scared of failing, I want this extra money so bad, but the more I think about Profits, the more I am going to lose
