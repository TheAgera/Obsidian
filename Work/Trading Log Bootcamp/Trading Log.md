### Today's trade
I decided to take a trade on SPX, price was inside a 30m fair value gap, along with entering london session high. Price broke structure on the 1m and I entered. My trade did hit tp1, then price rallied at market open. Why? THERE WAS A MASSIVE IMBALANCE along with resting liquidity. I decided to stay in the trade which was dumb because I wasn't following my rules. I only made Money today because TJR took a short after the rally because the 1hr high got swept along with other confluences. 

**For the future, I NEED to look at the higher timeframes to find confluences. I am so focused on the session high and low strategy that I completely forget about everything else**

Today I thought gold looked nice, I was able to catch a small short off a 1hr liquidity sweep, break of structure, and orderblock. It hit tp1 and I was stopped at break even. I did good at this point, but then I tried to revenge trade, because I had only risked .5%. I thought my reentry was nice but set my stopless to smalll because I was emotional. Currently I would be up well over a % if I had traded emotionless, and been more patient. I then traded SPX as per TJR reccomendations. The entry was the same as gold, and got tp1 with stop a break even. SPX might run more, but honestly I am okay today as i am up about .4%.
- IF I were to do better, I need to start being more robotic during my trades. and especially after I place the trade. I can't seem to ever look away from the charts. I also need to be patient, as I realize there are about 3 trades you can take between 8am, and 10:30am. So if I be patient I can wait for the perfect setup. 
## UPDATE: Once price took out london buy side liquidty, PRICE DID WHAT I THOUGH IT WAS GOING TO DO.... WAIT FOR LIQUIDITY SWEEP YESSS

I took a Gold long today, I am currently still in the trade as no TP or SL has been hit. My HTF Bias was long, Everything below the daily was showing a bullish shift in structure. There was a FVG on the daily time frame that I thought price was going to go into, and the send price further down. Price ended up sweeping the weekly liquidity before 8am NYS started. At session start, price immediately fell down, with a small small retracement then consolidate for the rest of the day. Price ended up sweeping london session sell side liquidity and broke structure on 5m and 15m but not higher than that. I entered off of that alone. In hindsight, I should've started at the weekly and noticed weekly liquidty was sweept, meaning we were going to really down a bit. GOLD is bearish and will continue to be bearisdh unless we get a htf break of structure.
- Update, trade ended up working out, it was until before NYSE close that price began to rally. However, i believe that to be luck. Gol

I had a perfect gold short set up today after news, but I was scared to take it. IT was a simple EQ play. My only issue was I was waiting for confirmation off of Equilibrium, when in reality I already have confirmation through the liquidity, break of structure that caused the initial movedown. EQ was just to find a retracement in case you missed the original entry. Overall because I know for next time and I know that in a few years I will be very profitable. Also today was a news day and I really shouldnt have traded anyways.

I took a trade on XAUUSD today. I could've taken two. Weekly was bearish, daily was bearish, but 4hr was bullish. Price was coming down and I initially saw a really good long oppurtinity off of a order block and break of structure. I didn't see a liquidity sweep. That order block pushed price up and did sweep liquidity, and broke structure to the downside. I took this trade because it was in line with my daily bias. However once I was in the trade, I started to get anxious because I wasn't very confident and ended up entering too early, and exiting too early. I am scared of failing, I want this extra money so bad, but the more I think about Profits, the more I am going to lose

Currently my daily bias is bearish, but i don't see any bearish setups, and the only short I could take would be a retracement play off of a fair value gap or equilibrium. Otherwise, a long makes more sense to me as we just swept daily liquidity. Will stay patient to see what market does. Might not trade today. Ended up trading today. Gold swept daily liquidity, and pushed up into EQ, I missed that play, but found a 15 minute fvg  it pushed into and took the trade off of that. Risked 1%, and only made .75%, but overall on the week I am up 2% on my account and I can't complain about that.

My Daily Bias today was bearish, and I had found a perfect setup off of EQ, however, I changed my bias to bullish because I thought since we had swept Daily Liquidity we were going to get a break of structure + rally, however I was wrong. I should never be changing my daily bias. Today I lost 1%. Overall account is up 1.5%

I messed up big today. My account is down 5%. I traded during news, I trade again, and risked way too much. Even then, I am just itching to take another trade. I wanted to cry after losing 5% on MY PAPER ACCOUNT. ITS NOT EVEN REAL??? WHY DO I CARE??? Because the longer this takes, the longer I have to wait to stop worrying about money. I was about to put my fake account back at 200,000. However, I welcome this challenge and I think I would be very proud if I could bring hte account back up from a deficit because this is going to happen when I am live trading on my own account.
What did I learn:
	Not to trade on news
	It is going to be years before i start making money from this

Today is a high impact news day. I could trade, and I could make tons of money, but there is no point as I do not want to take on that kind of risk. Its like working out with an injury; sure it could get better, but the chance of you further injuring yourself is never worth it.

My account is back at break even! If I can do that, there's no reason I can't make 10% this month and 10% the next month, and then get my funded. I risked .25% today, and I should've risked 0% as today is FOMC at 2pm. FOMC is one of, if not the HIGHEST impact news, so no trading should be happening. You can even see volume slowing down over the last 24 hours because of FOMC. Lots of volatility and strategies not working because of that. STAY AWAY. DON"T OPEN TRADING VIEW AGAIN TODAY

Today I risked 1%, and so far am up .5% in secured profits and have a safe stop loss. Today was unemployment claims at 8:30 which essentially took out immediate liquiidty on both sides. Everything was bearish besides the 1 hr. After news, price went up into an hourly order block, and after that I waited for 15 minute break of structure. I entered off of the 5 min break of structure. I got scarred because as i entered, price ramped back up which looked like my 5 min break of structure was going to be a 5min liquidity sweep. I could've entered another 1% and had a much better entry, but I am still up a percent today, and could be up 1.5%. Over all good day

Today is a friday, no news. Gold was swept weekly liquidity. I expect a reversal to the upside soon, but we shall see.  I risked 2% on a short that was honestly a terrible move. I got impatient because I thought that since it was friday there would be low volume after a certain time. I'm not even sure what I noticed... There was no liqiudity sweep, 15min bos, and then a fair value gap that got ignored so it doesnt even matter. I think focusing on my emotions during all of this is more important. I'm SO upset I lost this trade, and during the entire time all I could think about was how stressed the trade made me. I should be confident, because I found a good setup and have nothing to worry about. I lost this trade, all I can do is recognize what I did wrong and move on and be happy that I made a mistake I can learn from. Mistakes were: over emotional, didn't wait for liquidity sweep. We just got a liquidity sweep, but i just can't trade again. That would be breaking my rules. It is a friday and price is going to chop-chop because of low volume. I have to wait for a liquidity sweep at the MINIMUM

I was not mentally prepared to trade today as I am still feeling ill. I noticed a big 4 hour fvg that price tapped into it, I was waiting for the break of structure following the liq sweep + fvg and I thought there was a 5min bos, but it ended up being a wick by the time I entered. What could I have done better today? Don't trade if I feel sick, and adjust my bias if needed as price was bearish today and I thought it was bullish.

# Weekly Review for the week of 8-28/9-1

This is probably my worst week in trading, losing 6% of my account... Let's take a step back and see what I did wrong on each trade this week

### Monday
Last week we had taken out what I thought to be daily buyside liquidity, however that was actually a doji candle, and shouldn't be used for strong confluence in my direction. I did the usual TJR forex strategy, but what I failed to notice is that we just swept MONTHLY liquidity meaning price was going to continue going on up. I also failed to notice that the monthly was bullish. If I had checked that we swept monthly liquidity I most likely would've gone bullish. Also, I poplace three trades this day showing I was too emotional. I also don't have a check list for this day proving I was too emotional. I also keep doing this thing where I keep looking for order blocks and it just isn't working. liq sweep and break of structure are the two most important. 

### Tuesday

This was a heavy news day, which caused price to rocket up and form this fair value gap. My idea was to take the short and fill the fair value gap. However market was not interested in filling the fair value gap for the entire week. I was so deadset on this fair value gap being filled that I went way overboard, however, price is following 



# 9-5-23

No news today, price has filled the fair value gap from last week and now I am looking for a long position. Waiting for a 15m or even 30 m break of structure + a sweep of london session lows before I enter the trade. I could possibly see bos, and then a liq sweep down to the london session lows. Price swep london session lows, and I entered 5 lots on the 15min bos, and then another 5lots after a slight retracement. If the 30 minute candle closes bullish and gives a bos I think I am in the clear, but we shall see... I got my 30 minute break of structure and I could also be seeing an hourly break of structure. Well hourly and 30 minute look like it is going to rebreak structure. Absolutely beautiful. I'm so happy right now. I got stopped out and price is seemingly ignoring the fair value gap and is continuing further down. I'm not sure what I did wrong, unless I am not understanding fair value gaps, they are a retracement tool. Will need to analyze further.

I think my mistake today is having difficulty deciding my bias. I saw an opportunity for for a short and a long, but I was in my head so much that I ended up forcing a trade. Honestly I just wasn't focused today. It didn't sweep assian session lows. London session highs made like an order block, and that got file half before price dropping along with a nice 5 min BOS and a retreacement. Honestly that was the trade to take, but my bias was more bullish that I day so I was wating for a long to happen. I ended up taking a long off a 5 min bos , but there was no liq sweep so I should have entered into the trade. I think I am going to wake up to price being up, because the accumulation zone was just touched.
