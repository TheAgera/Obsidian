### Today's trade
I decided to take a trade on SPX, price was inside a 30m fair value gap, along with entering london session high. Price broke structure on the 1m and I entered. My trade did hit tp1, then price rallied at market open. Why? THERE WAS A MASSIVE IMBALANCE along with resting liquidity. I decided to stay in the trade which was dumb because I wasn't following my rules. I only made Money today because TJR took a short after the rally because the 1hr high got swept along with other confluences. 

**For the future, I NEED to look at the higher timeframes to find confluences. I am so focused on the session high and low strategy that I completely forget about everything else**

Today I thought gold looked nice, I was able to catch a small short off a 1hr liquidity sweep, break of structure, and orderblock. It hit tp1 and I was stopped at break even. I did good at this point, but then I tried to revenge trade, because I had only risked .5%. I thought my reentry was nice but set my stopless to smalll because I was emotional. Currently I would be up well over a % if I had traded emotionless, and been more patient. I then traded SPX as per TJR reccomendations. The entry was the same as gold, and got tp1 with stop a break even. SPX might run more, but honestly I am okay today as i am up about .4%.
- IF I were to do better, I need to start being more robotic during my trades. and especially after I place the trade. I can't seem to ever look away from the charts. I also need to be patient, as I realize there are about 3 trades you can take between 8am, and 10:30am. So if I be patient I can wait for the perfect setup.
