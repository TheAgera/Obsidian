### Today's trade
I decided to take a trade on SPX, price was inside a 30m fair value gap, along with entering london session high. Price broke structure on the 1m and I entered. My trade did hit tp1, then price rallied at market open. Why? THERE WAS A MASSIVE IMBALANCE along with resting liquidity. I decided to stay in the trade which was dumb because I wasn't following my rules. I only made Money today because TJR took a short after the rally because the 1hr high got swept along with other confluences. 

**For the future, I NEED to look at the higher timeframes to find confluences. I am so focused on the session high and low strategy that I completely forget about everything else**
