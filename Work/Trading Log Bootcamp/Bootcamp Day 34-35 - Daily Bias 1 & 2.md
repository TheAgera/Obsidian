Start at the monthly timeframe and figure out whether we are in a uptrend or downtrend, where liquidity is at, and other confluences.
Work you way down into the weekly and daily to see if your monthly analysis makes sense.

We look at weekly and identify a weekly bullish, then we head over to the daily and understand the daily trend

If we are bullish, but within a RETRACEMENT in the daily, do we wanna take the retracement trade or the extension of the trend?
We want to trade the extension 

We go from finding the daily trend, go down to 4hr/1hr for a high confluence area of building blocks (order block, fvg), and finnally scale down even further to find liquidity sweep, break of structure, and smaller building blocks to find that sniper entry
