### Wazuh
	I will need to create a PDQ package to add Sysmon to the Windows End Devices along with a PDQ package to install the agent. So itll be PDQ package for agent, then install sysmon and add sysmon rules to local agent. 
	- 
	**UPDATE** All you can configure is what level alert gets sent through . THis means we will have to update the level for each rule we want to use. I will also invesigate user made rulesets for windows domain joined end devices. 
	I am testing rule 60106 for active response. I have the command and active response setup on the manager in ossec, nothing configured on the local agent. Something is wrong, as the active response is not being triggered


#### Other Tasks to keep in mind
- Resume work on zabbix templates
	- Organize into low, medium, high, and DANGER alerts
	- low is information, issues that affect IT, high affect end user, DANGER is data or hardware loss

##### Goals for 6-24
- Have PDQ package running before launch
	- Need to add the .conf file configuration to the PDQ package

## Tasks for 6/24:

- [x] Create PDQ package for wazuh
- [ ] Define a standard method for creating alerts and rules

## Notes:

- I did the PDQ package for Wazuh, still need to add the sysmon install, and ossec conf checks, but those will come once I have a finalized method for every workstation will be configured, that was about 4 hours
- Brady Printer IP300 has some issues with the fan (sounds like its "giving up") and there is some thermal aspect that doesn't seem to work
- 

## Tasks for 6/25

- [ ] Learn how custom rules and active response work seperately and on their own
- [ ] Create a standard operating procedure for custom rules, alerts, and active response

### Notes
- Sysmon is installed with a config, with a balanced generated output of Sysmon-modular with medium verbosity. for more information go to https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/wiki     Knowing this, once we trim the fat, we might be able to get rid of sysmon integration.
- To configure active response on the Wazuh manager, navigate to /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf  below is an example active response with a custom command
![[Code_9ABUnAd0fM.png]]
The flow goes a rule_id is trigger, which calls the active response, and that calls the command. The trigger can be a specific rule ID, rule level, or a group of rules. Active response can be made in ANY programming language. 

Supposedly the custom script receives and processes a JSON message containing the alert details (how does script know what to look for??)


## 6/26 Tasks

- [ ] Filter alerts for Wazuh and continue making rules for the app.

#### Notes
- I am struggling to find out how to make a detailed email/ alert configuration. It seems I can only adjust the level of rules that come through, but I need to get more specific on what comes through. I should be able to add low, medium, high, and critical alerts.
- Right now we have wazuh alerts being sent through teams with this guide here
  https://www.infopercept.com/blogs/sending-alerts-to-microsoft-teams-from-wazuh/
- My current idea is we would have to MANUALLY change each rule's level, and then try to do multiple integrations/webhooks with teams.
- Another idea is to use the wazuh dashboard (open search) for events low or medium, then high and critical can be send through email/teams
- I am starting to think WAZUH does not contain the capabilities we are looking for. I will need to do more with open search integration or do some actual testing.

### 6/27 Tasks/Notes

- [ ] Wrap up notes on what I've learned with Wazuh
- [ ] Continue building the AutoCAD GUI

#### Notes Wazuh
- I feel confident in writing custom rules and active responses for said rules. However, having alerts and notifications we receive as a team with deep customization feels like something I am unable to accomplish. 

#### AutoCAD gui script continuation

- 
- A way to open the file location of the folder modified
	- I can already call the autocadfile.filepath to get the file path of the file. Then in the context menu, have a button that opens the file locaiton, or have a double click funciton that only works when file is double clicked?
- A file backup function if not already added
	- This would be easy to implement if every file that was being worked on was in the same folder, so that way a folder called "BACKUP" could be made in the CAD directory of the job under the file server.
- Run button might need to be optimized?? Hide Powershell window. This seems fine for now
- Error checking for the scripts
- Error checking for if the drawings are worked or not when running
-
