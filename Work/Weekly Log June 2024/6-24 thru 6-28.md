	I will need to create a PDQ package to add Sysmon to the Windows End Devices along with a PDQ package to install the agent. So itll be PDQ package for agent, then install sysmon and add sysmon rules to local agent. 
	- 
	**UPDATE** All you can configure is what level alert gets sent through . THis means we will have to update the level for each rule we want to use. I will also invesigate user made rulesets for windows domain joined end devices. 
	I am testing rule 60106 for active response. I have the command and active response setup on the manager in ossec, nothing configured on the local agent. Something is wrong, as the active response is not being triggered


#### Other Tasks to keep in mind
- Resume work on zabbix templates
	- Organize into low, medium, high, and DANGER alerts
	- low is information, issues that affect IT, high affect end user, DANGER is data or hardware loss

##### Goals for 6-24
- Have PDQ package running before launch
	- Need to add the .conf file configuration to the PDQ package
