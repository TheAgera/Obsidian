### Wazuh
	I will need to create a PDQ package to add Sysmon to the Windows End Devices along with a PDQ package to install the agent. So itll be PDQ package for agent, then install sysmon and add sysmon rules to local agent. 
	- 
	**UPDATE** All you can configure is what level alert gets sent through . THis means we will have to update the level for each rule we want to use. I will also invesigate user made rulesets for windows domain joined end devices. 
	I am testing rule 60106 for active response. I have the command and active response setup on the manager in ossec, nothing configured on the local agent. Something is wrong, as the active response is not being triggered


#### Other Tasks to keep in mind
- Resume work on zabbix templates
	- Organize into low, medium, high, and DANGER alerts
	- low is information, issues that affect IT, high affect end user, DANGER is data or hardware loss

##### Goals for 6-24
- Have PDQ package running before launch
	- Need to add the .conf file configuration to the PDQ package

## Tasks for 6/24:

- [x] Create PDQ package for wazuh
- [ ] Define a standard method for creating alerts and rules

## Notes:

- I did the PDQ package for Wazuh, still need to add the sysmon install, and ossec conf checks, but those will come once I have a finalized method for every workstation will be configured, that was about 4 hours
- Brady Printer IP300 has some issues with the fan (sounds like its "giving up") and there is some thermal aspect that doesn't seem to work
- 

## Tasks for 6/25

- [ ] Learn how custom rules and active response work seperately and on their own
- [ ] Create a standard operating procedure for custom rules, alerts, and active response

### Notes
- Sysmon is installed with a config, with a balanced generated output of Sysmon-modular with medium verbosity. for more information go to https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/wiki     Knowing this, once we trim the fat, we might be able to get rid of sysmon integration.
- To configure active response on the Wazuh manager, navigate to /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf  below is an example active response with a custom command
![[Code_9ABUnAd0fM.png]]
The flow goes a rule_id is trigger, which calls the active response, and that calls the command. The trigger can be a specific rule ID, rule level, or a group of rules. Active response can be made in ANY programming language. 

Supposedly the custom script receives and processes a JSON message containing the alert details (how does script know what to look for??)
