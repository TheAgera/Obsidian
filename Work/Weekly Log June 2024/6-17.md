Only one day this week due to me taking PTO for the rest of the week. Might come in saturday to do stuff.

#### Goals for Today
##### Completing App Backend
- Implement optimized 
- Add an option for populating "preferred Name"
- Modal datagrid, DG_outputUsers needs a delete button for each row
##### Completing App FrontEnd

- Modal: Outside box has straight corners, inside box has rounded corners, does not have the traditional window close buttons
- Other: user should be notified, of where there files are being saved, and a button to open that folder location with file explorer upon script running.
