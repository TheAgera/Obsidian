1. Install the envision software, set up drivers, connect to the rotary!!!
2. Creating AutoCAD drawing
3. Saving .DWG to .DXF, open in Vision Expert 9
4. .DXF settings ![[cadlink_hazmQyV0Zb.png]]
5. Font Replacement (investigate how doing the font replacement affects windows font)
6. Once imported, delete layers, send to machine by color.
7. In the engrave screen, configure the plastic engrave and plastic cut settings

10. zero cutters (will need to do each time machine is rebooted)
11. set cut depth with micrometer
12. begin cut

### Creating AutoCAD drawing
Similar to the glowforge, the drawings opened by this machine will need to be in a seperate file. You can import entire large drawings, however there are somethings to be certain of. NO autocad items on by color, needs to be by layer, and cannot have duplicate layers. The time required to import a large drawing is not worth it from a time perspective. You can create about multiple templates in one file, but I wouldn't go over ten. 
The dimensions of the Envision Laser is 12x16, however we need to keep room for tape, so the border will be 10x14. Put what you wish to engrave inside that border, then save the file as a .dxf 2018.
Inside the Envision software, you will need to do some initial setup. ** TEST TO SEE IF THE VISION SOFTWARE CAN WORK ON OTHER COMPUTERS https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1544rfh/exact_clone_of_usb_flash_drive_including_device/ **
