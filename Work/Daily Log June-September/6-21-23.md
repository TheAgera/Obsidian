## Tasks for Today:

- [ ] IOSTAT - Finalize the command to generate data
- [ ] Learn how to create RAM DISK and verify that data can be written and read fast enough
- [ ] Begin automated script to generate data, store in ram disk, and aggregate the data so zabbix can read (60 data points combined into 1 average)

## Notes:

- If I do iostat -d sda -y 1 5, I get five results at one second intervals. I see the column headers, so I need to get rid of that from the command. I also think I want 60 intervals.
	-  I should use sed or awk to remove the spaces within bash
	-  Working command : iostat -d sda -y 1 60 | sed "1,3d; s/^[[:space:]]*//; /^$/d; s/[[:blank:]]\+/,/g" | sed '3,$ s/Device,tps,kB_read\/s,kB_wrtn\/s,kB_dscd\/s,kB_read,kB_wrtn,kB_dscd//; /^$/d;' > iostat.csv
- Note 2
- For my script, I am going to have a CSV file that gets filled with data

## What I Learned
