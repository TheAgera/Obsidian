## Tasks for Today:

- [ ] Plotter Printer Received New Print
- [ ] Tactical Received New Web Cert
- [ ] Lisa's Emails were fixed
- [ ] VM's were made for 7733

## Notes:

- After cleaning the contacts, the print head still failed. We probably could've fixed it, but the cost would be the same as just buying a new one.
- For tactical, our DNS provider is something known as Hover, there the TXT record had to be made
- For lisa's email it was a two part issue. Firstly, outlook was grouping emails into conversations together. The other issue was the amount of sub folders, there 508, while using cached exchange mode, the limit is 500, however disabling cached exchange mode makes the limit 5000. Also, Outlook web app is the "master" version, the desktop version pulls from OWA.
- Two windows 10 VM's were made for 7733, the process of making these VMs were very simple. I have a screenshot of the general settings you will want to do for a windows 10 vm.
