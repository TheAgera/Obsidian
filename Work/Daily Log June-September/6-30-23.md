- [ ] Fix Keith Walker Factory ME Error, Run through the install on a vm
- [ ] Setup the RAMDISK and my Script(s) in APPL-35, Potentially update my script to include more values, meaning the iostat command will end in -x. This would mean my script and bash command need to be updated. In zabbix, I need to add units to my items
- [ ] Task 3

## Notes:

- Keith reported this issue happens when 
- For My Script, it was reccomended to include the full stats report using iostat -x, however there are many variables to keep track of. 
- Note 3

## Ideas:

- The error message says  the required SQL Server LocalDB instance is not found. What I am guessing is he doesn't have the correct version of SQL installed relative to his version of factory talk SE. Otherwise, there is another localdb of SQL running on his machine that factory talk is grabbing. I am going to try just uninstalling all of the SQL stuff and Factory talk
- Find a sql server browser and try edit the config, or take Mike's image and try to install it on there
