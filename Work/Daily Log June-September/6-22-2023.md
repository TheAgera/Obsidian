## Notes:

- For my script, I am going to be taking the CSV that contains the 60 values, and grabbing the max value + average for each column. I am then going to pump those into a new file within the ram disk. The file with have the time stamp.
- Note 2
- Note 3

## Ideas:

-  We are going to setup the script, so that it goes through the entire row, and grabs each data point between commas, and calls it a average for A-E. Then, in the first row we would A1,B1,C1,D1, and E1 also our count variable would be 1 at this point. It would loop through each row until 60. Now we have A1:A60-E1:E60 and a count of 60. Then we would take the average and max of this.
