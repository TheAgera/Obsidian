#### Door Card Generator GUI/App
I want this application to take either a list of csv names, or a list of ad-users from using get-aduser. From there, a list view will be generated of all the names. With the listview generated, the user can select what names they want to work on from the list view. You will also select if you want to make rectangle or swoop. Datagrid instead of listview

Remaining items for script to function properly
- Add a "cart" button similar to an e-commerce store to show added users and what type they are
- Complete logic for dividing up primary and secondary files
- Add error checking throughout the script
- Add tool tips through the GUI
- Finish visual design
