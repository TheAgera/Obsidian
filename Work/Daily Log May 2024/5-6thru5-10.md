### Door Plates
- Create rectangle in black and blue, create swoop in black and blue, whose name am I using on the test plates?
- In the file server, all files are there ready for printing. They do need to be converted to "object to path"
- Create a text file for the rectangular plate measurements
- Create a text file for the laser power settings for each cut, along with instructions.
 I am making 
 - four total name plates, two swoop, two rectangle
 - One set of blue and black letters for rectangle
 - One set of blue and black letters for swoop
 - One set of 1/8 backing of black and blue for swoop
 - One set of 1/16 backing of black and blue for rectangle

### Wazuh
	I will need to create a PDQ package to add Sysmon to the Windows End Devices along with a PDQ package to install the agent. So itll be PDQ package for agent, then install sysmon and add sysmon rules to local agent. 
	**UPDATE** All you can configure is what level alert gets sent through . THis means we will have to update the level for each rule we want to use. I will also invesigate user made rulesets for windows domain joined end devices. 
	I am testing rule 60106 for active response. I have the command and active response setup on the manager in ossec, nothing configured on the local agent. Something is wrong, as the active response is not being triggered
