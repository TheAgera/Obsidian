#### AutoCAD Manager
- Run Scripts Page: Perfect besides help button not tied to page header
- Manage Library Page: Install Screen does not overlay, install tasks are synchronous and blocking, need to be async
- AutoCAD install: Needs a delete button, idk where to put it, update the help page instructions, might want to change AutoCAD targeting from . Page needs to refresh after install and somehow refresh the other page.. Migrate profile box needs to look for AutoCAD versions for the profile migrator.
- General Fixes: Switch blocks needs to be inside the Switch folder or each type of switch gets a path to registry
