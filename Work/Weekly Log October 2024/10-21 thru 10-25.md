#### AutoCAD Manager
- Run Scripts Page: Perfect besides help button not tied to page header
- Manage Library Page: Install Screen does not overlay, install tasks are synchronous and blocking, need to be async
- AutoCAD install: Needs a delete button, idk where to put it, , might want to change AutoCAD targeting from acadlt.exe to something in the registry. Page needs to refresh after install and somehow refresh the other page.. Migrate profile box needs to look for AutoCAD versions for the profile migrator.
- General Fixes: Switch blocks needs to be inside the Switch folder or each type of switch gets a path to registry

#### Issues Affecting End Users
- Lisa's desk setup
- Isaiah Siemens/Rockwell issue
