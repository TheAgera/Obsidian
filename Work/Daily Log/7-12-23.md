## Notes:

- Not updating much as I am working on the same things, got a ramdisk auto create setup with a backup so that is cool. My big issue currently in zabbix is that the bash script, python script, and zabbix items are all working at different times, and each zabbix item is working at different times.
- In my bash script, iostat runs for 60 seconds, but then I am telling it to sleep for 60 seconds which is why there is a two minute gap between data collection.
