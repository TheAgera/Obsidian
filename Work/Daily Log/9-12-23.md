## Tasks for Today:

- [ ] Manage the lenovo support rep and make sure Elmer's laptop gets fixed
- [ ] Make progress on my zabbix script for disk stats
- [ ] Task 3

## Notes:

- Note 1
- In the root directory of cciadmin, I have ramdisk.sh which creates a ramdisk under /mnt/ramdisk. There is also a zabbixtest folder
	  Inside of the zabbixtest folder, is a script that says while true, run iostat with the sed command, save taht to /mnt/ramdisk/iostatx.csv, then the python script gets called in the same location, then the program sleeps
	  "### While True Loop

The `while true` loop is an infinite loop in Bash that will run until it is manually stopped (usually by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or killing the process). The `true` command in Bash always returns a 0 (zero) which is interpreted as a "true" boolean value, so the loop keeps running.

### How it works in this case

- The loop starts and runs the `iostat` command.
    
    - `iostat -d sda -x 1 60`: This is a system monitoring command that reports statistics for the `sda` disk device. It refreshes every second (`1`) for `60` times.
- Next, it pipes (`|`) the output to a series of `sed` commands.
    
    - `sed 's/ \+/,/g'`: Replaces one or more spaces with a comma. This essentially changes the output format to CSV-like.
    - `sed '/^$/d'`: Removes empty lines.
    - `sed '1d;/^$/d'`: Removes the first line and any empty lines.
- The final output is redirected to a CSV file (`> /mnt/ramdisk/iostatx.csv`).
    
- Then it runs a Python3 script (`/mnt/ramdisk/iostatx.py`) which presumably processes this CSV file further.
    
- Finally, the script waits for 65 seconds (`sleep 65`) before the loop starts over."
