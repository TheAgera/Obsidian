## Notes:

- Lisa mentioned today that the email dissapeared out of her inbox without doing anything 
- Note 2
- Let's review how my zabbix script worked. I remember I had a RAMdisk setup, which I can see in the home directory of a file called "ramdisk.sh" 
- Inside of mnt/ramdisk I see iostatx.csv
- in the /mnt folder I have ramdisk-backup and ramdisk_backup
- The first one is empty, but the second seems to copying something. Has the python script
