## Tasks for Today:

- [ ] Make progress on my zabbix script for disk stats
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## Notes:

- Note 1
- In the root directory of cciadmin, I have ramdisk.sh which creates a ramdisk under /mnt/ramdisk. There is also a zabbixtest folder
	  Inside of the zabbixtest folder, is a script that says while true, run iostat with the sed command, save taht to /mnt/ramdisk/iostatx.csv, then the python script gets called in the same location, then the program sleeps
	  "### While True Loop

The `while true` loop is an infinite loop in Bash that will run until it is manually stopped (usually by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal, or killing the process). The `true` command in Bash always returns a 0 (zero) which is interpreted as a "true" boolean value, so the loop keeps running.

### How it works in this case

- The loop starts and runs the `iostat` command.
    
    - `iostat -d sda -x 1 60`: This is a system monitoring command that reports statistics for the `sda` disk device. It refreshes every second (`1`) for `60` times.
- Next, it pipes (`|`) the output to a series of `sed` commands.
    
    - `sed 's/ \+/,/g'`: Replaces one or more spaces with a comma. This essentially changes the output format to CSV-like.
    - `sed '/^$/d'`: Removes empty lines.
    - `sed '1d;/^$/d'`: Removes the first line and any empty lines.
- The final output is redirected to a CSV file (`> /mnt/ramdisk/iostatx.csv`).
    
- Then it runs a Python3 script (`/mnt/ramdisk/iostatx.py`) which presumably processes this CSV file further.
    
- Finally, the script waits for 65 seconds (`sleep 65`) before the loop starts over."

## How the python script works

1. **Importing Libraries**: `csv`, `json`, `os`, `shutil`, and `time` are imported for file operations, JSON and CSV parsing, and time-related tasks.
    
2. **`read_and_process_csv()` Function**:
    
    - `averages` and `max_values` dictionaries: Store the average and max value for specified keys.
    - `keys`: This list specifies the keys (column headers) in the CSV file to focus on.
    - `with open(file_path, 'r') as file`: Opens the CSV file.
    - `csv.DictReader(file)`: Reads the CSV as a dictionary where each row is a dictionary mapping the column name to the value.
    - `data = {key: [] for key in keys}`: Initializes a dictionary where the keys are from the `keys` list and values are empty lists.
    
    For each row in `csv_reader`:
    
    - It checks if each specified `key`'s value is a number (ignoring the decimal point).
    - If yes, it converts it to a float and appends it to the corresponding list in `data`.
    
    After reading all rows:
    
    - Calculate the average and max for each key and store them in `averages` and `max_values`.
        
    - Finally, it calls `print_results()` and `create_new_json()` functions, and backs up the CSV file with a timestamp using `save_csv_with_timestamp()`.
        
3. **`print_results()` Function**: Takes `averages` and `max_values` dictionaries and prints them.
    
4. **`save_csv_with_timestamp()` Function**:
    
    - Generates a timestamp.
    - Copies the original CSV file and appends the timestamp to its name.
5. **`create_new_json()` Function**: Takes `averages` and `max_values`, combines them into one dictionary, and writes it to a JSON file.
    
6. **`__name__ == "__main__":`**: Starts the script by calling `read_and_process_csv()` with the file path `'iostatx.csv'`.
