# Tasks for the week

##### Issues affecting end users
- GlowForge follow trouble shooting steps from glowforge email. (this saturday)





### Wazuh

#### ACAD Menu Project
- Application with page for running scripts and install/updating menu
- powershell script to create the menu from an excel document
- The folder/file structure with all of the blocks for inserting
- The script folder containing scripts made by IT or ENG
- The excel document containing a databse of each blocks and the blocks attributes
	- The excel document and powershell JUST adds the block database, updating the menu visually (like adding pictuers) is still a manual process rip. Might want to figure out to add the menugroup.cui into the archive of ACADMENU.cuix
- Order is Menu GUI I made in AutoCAD, folder/file structure with all of the blocks, an excel database representing the blocks and their attributes, a powershell script to generate the menugroup.cui, .cui file gets placed inside of the .cuix archive, Application to load the menu and folders, application to run scripts.

#### ACAD Menu Project Remaining Items
- Run Scripts Page:  Log report include a right click context menu, figure out where the console write line /standard output /standarderror is writing too. Was working, just needing Unicode encoding (idk why). Add levels to the event logs. 
- Install Page: figure out where we want files to be saved locally
- Profile Page:  progress bar, add combobox for selecting current autoCAD version
