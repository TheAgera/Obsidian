Projects I am working On
- AutoCAD Manager
- Wazuh
- Vision Engraver
- Door Signs
- Server Room Cleanup
- Zabbix Refresh
- AutoCAD building drawing, populate names from AD
- Go through phone list, figure out who is deactivated
I want to complete remaining items on AutoCAD Manager so it can be given to one of the engineers on monday. What needs to be done with this:
	- Make seperate page for AutoCAD install and functionality for AutoCAD install
	- Profile migrate https://help.autodesk.com/view/ACDLT/2025/ENU/index.html?guid=GUID-D4502890-6980-4942-8841-7248F4ECA848
	- Review Visual Design 


Issues Affecting End Users:
- 
- Brady IP600 loud noises, fan issue, not sure what to do
- Elmer Monitor Arms & Tony Gohl Monitor Arms, they have the same desk
