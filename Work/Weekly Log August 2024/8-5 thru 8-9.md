### AutoCAD Manager App
Goals for Today:
- Finish ENG VM with studio 18-36 (minus version 22)
-  View the event log from right click context menu
- AutoCAD install from button click, thinking of a modal that opens up to notify
- Make profile migrate use the CMD process
What Looks Wrong Visually
	- The header for each page is different size, can't adjust width of the box
	- Where to put "help modal" at? Or should I have a new page that loads a user manual 
	- On install page, how to get Text labels to fit with page, where to put installing AutoCAD program at? Also help page?
	- On profile page, I can't choose which version to migrate too, since we aren't using .lisp files yet, I figured its not a needed feature at this point in time. Where to put help button. Update 2.0 feature
	- Do we wanna keep debug page?
