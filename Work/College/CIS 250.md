	- Information Systems: Combination of technology, people, and data to perform certain business functions
- What Does a Systems Analyst Do?
- Plans, developls, and maintains information systems
- Manages IT projects, including tasks, resources, schedules, and cost
- Conducts meetings, deliveres presentations, and writes memos, reports, and documentation.
##### Information System Components
System: Set of related components that produces specific results
	Mission-critical systems are vital to a company's operations
All systems require input data
	Data: Basic facts that serve as raw material
		Information: data transformed into output
	Hardware:
		Physical layer of the information systems
		Moore's law was integral to the development of hardware
	Software:
		Controls hardware
		System software
		Application software
			Horizontal system
			Vertical system
			Legacy System
	Data, stored in tables
	Processes, describes the tasks and business functions perform to achieve specific functions
	People,
###### Business Today
Influenced by:
- Rapidly increasing globalization
- Technology integration for seamless information access
- Rapid growth of cloud-based computing and services
All trends are internet centric
The Internet Model:
	Ecommerce
	User Interface - Enables communcation between a data-base management software and a web-based server
		- Mobile devices interact with the system using apps
		Sectors
			B2C (business-to-customer)
			B2B (business-to-business)
B2C:
- in a single convenient session, customers can:
	- Do research and compare prices and features
	- Check availability and arrange delivery
	- Choose payment methods
B2B
- Ecommerce was initially carried out using electronic data interchange (EDI)
	- Do research and compare prices and features
	- Check availability and arrange delivery
	- Choose payment methods

###### Modeling Business Operations
Business Profile:
	Overview of a company's mission, functions, organization, products, services, customers, suppliers, competitors, constraints, and future direction
Business Process
	Specific set of transactions, events, and results that can be described and documented
	Business process model (BPM)
	Business process modeling notation (BPMN)

###### Business Information Systems
Current Method:
All employess use office productivity systems
Operations users require decision support systems
Systems are defined by their functions and features
Enterprise Computing
Supports company-wide operations and data management requirements
- Enterprise resource planning (ERP) 

Transcations Processing (TP) Systems:
	Processes data generated by day-to-day business operations
	Examples - Customer order processing, accounts receivable, and warranty claim processing
Business Support Systems:
	Provide job-related information support to users at all levels 
Management Infromation Systems (MIS)
RFID

Knowledge Management:
	Uses a knowledge base and infernce rules
		- Knowledge base: large databse that allows users to find information by entering keywords
		- Inference rules: identify data patterns and relationships

User Productivity Systems:
	Technology that improves productivity
	Groupware: enables data sharing and coordination of efforts
Systems Integration:
	Combination of transcation processing, business support, knowledge management, and user productivity features

###### What Information Do Users Need
Top Managers:
	Use IT to develop long-range strategic plans
		Require information such as economic forecasts, technology trends, competitive threats, and governmental issues
		
MiddleManagers and knowledge workers
	Middle managers provide direction, resources, and performance feedback to supervisors and team leaders
		Require more detailed information that top managers
	Knowledge workers provide support for the organization's basic functions
Supervisors and Team Leaders
	Oversee operational employees and carry out day-to-day functions
		Require decision support information, knowledge maangement systems, and user productivity systems
Operational Employees
	rely on TP systems to enter and receive data they need to perform their jobs
	empowered to handle tasks and make decisions that were assigned previously to supervisors

###### Systems Development Tools
Modeling:
	Graphical representation of a concept or process
		Business model
		Data model 
		Object model
		Network model
		Process model
Prototyping
	Early working version of an information system
		Disadvantage - Important decisions might be made before business or IT issues are thoroughly understood
	A prototype based on careful fact-finding and modeling techniques can be an extremely valuable tool
Computer-Aided Systems Engineering (CASE) tools
	Known as computer-aided software engineering
	Provide an overall framework for systems development
	Support design methodologies
		Structured analysis
		Object-oriented analysis
	Generate program code
		Speeds the implementation process
Systems Development Methods
	Structured Analysis Steps
		Time tested and easy to understand
		Uses the Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
		Predictive approach
		Step-by-step design
		Systems Planning
			- Initiated by a systems request
			- Goal - to perofrm a preliminary investigation
			- Feasibility study: Reviews anticipated costs and benefits and recommends a course of action
		- Systems Analysis
			- Goal - to build a logical model of the new systems
			- Requirements modeling: Analyst investigates business 
		- Systems design
			- Goal - to create a physical model to meet document requirements
			- UI is designed and application architecture is determined
			- Outputs, inputs, and processes are identified
			- Deliverable - System designed specification
			- Management and user involvement is critical
		- Systems implementaiton:
			- New system is constrcuted, programs are written, tested, and documented, and the system is installed
			- Deliverable - A completely functional and dcoumentation information system
			- Includes systems evaluation
		- Systems support and security
			- IT staff maintains, enhances, and protects the system
			- A well-designed system must be secure, reliable, maintanble, and scalable
		Object-Oriented Analysis
			- Purpose is to NOT reinvent the wheel, take what you have done before and reuse it
			- Combines data and the proceeses that act on the data into objects
		Agile/Adaptive Methods
			Invovle building and constanly adjusting a series of protoytpes to user reqs
			Use a spiral model
				Spiral model: series of iterations based on user feedback
				Feedback from prir steps is incorporated in each incremental step
			Allow developers to be more flexible and responsive
			Disadvantages:
				Riskier than traditional methods
				Weak documentation and blurred lines of accountability 
				lack of emphasis on the larger business picture
		Other Development Methods
			Joint Application Development (JAD)
				-Focuses on team-based fact-finding
			Rapid application development (RAD)
				-A compressed version of the entire development process
###### The Information Technology Department
Database Administration:
	Involves data design, management, security, backup, and access systems
Network Administration:
	Includes hardware and software maintenace, support, and security
Web Support:
	Web support specialists design and construct Web pages
		Monitor traffic and manage hardware and software 
		Link Web-based applications information systems to the company's information systems
Quality Assurance

###### The Systems Analyst
- Investigates, analyzes, designes, developes, installs, evaluates, and maintains a company's information systems
Roles: 
	Acts a translators to managers and programmers
	A company's best line of defense in an IT disaster
	Most valuable skill - The ability to listen
	Seeks feedback from users to ensure that systems do not deviate from accomplishing set objectives

### 9-11
During Presentation: 
- We are presenting to the class
- Why, Who, What, When and How  
	◦ Important questions that one must answer before  
communicating  
◦ Why - Know the reason behind the communication,  
and what needs to be accomplished  
◦ Who - Know the targets are and their information  
needs  
◦ What - Know what is expected and when to go into  
detail

15 Minute minimum

Pay attention to successful techniques and poor techniques from other groups

Every communication takes place within an overall cultural context. 
	Meaning, everyone has something about them that will have other people judging them for.

Writing Styles should be consistent

Express issues and problems you encountered, and explain 

Are tasks going to be explained in order?

Prepare Presentation Aids

##### CONSISTENT LOOK AND FEEL, SAME THEME
###### IMO, KEEP IT SIMPLE

Explain background behind answers, your thought process

SET a pace for a presentation.
