## Module 2

That’s right: culture! All three images are metaphors that anthropologists have used to describe the largely unconscious ways we learn to think, act, and interact as members of our communities. Culture:

1. has rules and instructions for behavior (software),
2. surrounds us and shapes our environment (like water to fish), and
3. interconnects different aspects of life – from ideology to politics to breakfast food (a web)
4. The concepts in the box below are your anthropological toolkit – found in bold type in your text – and we’ll be adding to them in each module. You’ll use these concepts in completing assignments, discussions, and tests.![[Pasted image 20240210212054.jpg]]![[Pasted image 20240210212250.png]]
