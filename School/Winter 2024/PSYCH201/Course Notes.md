## Module 2

As you read, be sure to carefully review the differences between the descriptive methods (i.e., case study, naturalistic observation, archival research, surveys) and experiments. In addition, you need to understand correlation and why you cannot infer causation from a correlation.

Scientific knowledge isÂ empirical: It is grounded in objective, tangible evidence that can be observed time and time again, regardless of who is observing.

Scientific research serves multiple purposes: understanding behavior, guiding public policy, and informing personal decisions. Through systematic inquiry, we discard misconceptions and gain objective insights into our world. Psychologists employ empirical evidence to understand behavior, distinguishing their approach from intuition or personal experience. While behavior is observable, the reasons behind it often require creative investigation. Research findings also inform public policy decisions, such as funding early intervention programs, by providing evidence of effectiveness. Individuals can use research to make informed decisions in their personal lives, such as seeking help for a child's developmental delays.

Accessing research information can be challenging due to contradictory studies, necessitating critical evaluation. Politicians, like governors allocating budget resources, rely on research to make informed decisions about policy priorities. Similarly, individuals, like concerned parents, may navigate overwhelming information to address personal concerns. The scientific method underpins research, involving deductive reasoning to test hypotheses against observations and inductive reasoning to generate theories from observations. Theories are refined based on empirical evidence, ensuring scientific knowledge evolves and remains reliable. Falsifiability distinguishes scientific hypotheses from unfalsifiable claims, allowing for rigorous testing and confidence in research findings.

**Learning Objectives** 
By the end of this section, you will be able to:

**Describe** the different research methods used by psychologists **Discuss** the strengths and weaknesses of case studies, naturalistic observation, surveys, and archival research **Compare** longitudinal and cross-sectional approaches to research **Compare and contrast** correlation and causation

There are various research methods available to psychologists for understanding behavior, cognition, and biological processes. These methods range from observational techniques to controlled experiments.

Each research method has its strengths and weaknesses, and its suitability depends on the research question. Observation-based methods, like case studies and naturalistic observation, provide rich data but may lack generalizability. Surveys allow for large sample sizes but are prone to self-report biases. Archival research utilizes existing records but lacks researcher control over data collection.

Correlational research examines relationships between variables but cannot establish causation. Experimental research, while powerful, may lack real-world validity and can raise ethical concerns.

**Clinical or Case Studies** Case studies, like the one on Krista and Tatiana Hogan, offer in-depth insights into unique individuals but may not generalize well to the broader population due to their specificity.

**Naturalistic Observation** Observing behavior in natural settings allows for high ecological validity but can be challenging to set up and control. Observer bias and participant reactivity are potential issues.

**Surveys** Surveys gather data from large samples quickly but are susceptible to response biases. They're useful for exploring attitudes, behaviors, and demographics.

**Archival Research** Using existing records, archival research provides historical insights but lacks control over data collection and may suffer from inconsistencies between records.

**Longitudinal and Cross-Sectional Research** Longitudinal studies track the same individuals over time, offering insights into development and changes, but are time-consuming and subject to attrition. Cross-sectional studies compare different groups at one point in time, providing insights into age-related differences but are limited by cohort effects.
