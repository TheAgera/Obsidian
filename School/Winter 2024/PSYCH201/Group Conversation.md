Hi maybe we should create a group chat with iMessage if its easier for everyone

I seem to get an email on my Schoolcraft account everytime someone sends a message. If that is the case, and we cannot use another messaging app, blackboard should work fine as long as we can get notified of a new message.

Egypt, did you make the Imessage group chat? If so I do not see it

Hello I saw everyone's text that we should transfer our conversation on here so the teacher can see our input. I did see CHADIA SALHI POSTED THIS

  

 Some of the topic questions:

- What are the ethical and moral implications of using drugs to alter consciousness?

- How do different cultures and societies view the use of drugs to alter consciousness?

- What are the long-term effects of drug use on consciousness and cognitive function?

- How do different drugs impact consciousness differently?

thank you Egypt to right down that I was about to do it

I Also seen Kyler posted this 

  

  

My interpretation is that as a group we select five articles related to our inquiry question. Our inquiry seems to have to be something from our textbook, our group is called Drugs(consciousness). So we will have to come up with a question related to that. If you go to the class in blackboard, content, course project, and assignment expectations it gives you a step by step guide on what we need to do.

The teacher just posted this so we all have to make a separate post directions are below. 

  

Therefore, I am **requiring** that **EVERY STUDENT POSTS IN THE GROUP CONVERSATION AREA BY SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 18 OR YOU WILL RECEIVE A FAILING GRADE ON THE FIRST GROUP PROJECT**. The content of your post is up to you but it should likely be an introduction of who you are, your availability, your interest in the topic or strengths related to the aspects of the project (i.e., research, graphics, etc.).

so guys please if you have anything in your mind just put down here, in this way we will analyze the points of view and then we will understand the requirements of the topic so we can reach the the correct path to complete the project successfully.

Hey guys, I feel like we should all meet so we can go over what inquiry question we want to do, and so we could each come up with some articles. I'm available to meet mostly any week day from 12-2 or on Sundays.

## 

Kyler Suess

2/14/24, 7:53 AM

The research inquiry I suggested was "What are the effects of stimulant use from an early age?" However, this question is focused and we might be limited in our research. I like Chadia's suggestions as the questions aren't specific so we can use many research articles.

  

As for meeting as a group, I am only free during the week 5-9, and I am free the entire weekend. Hopefully, we can meet as soon as possible so we can spend next week getting our project together and then go over and submit everything next weekend.

Hi everyone, for meeting I think it's just gonna take more time to set it up and that's what we don't have. We need to pick the inquiry question at least, so every one can do the research for the articles to post it as the instructor said to avoid the 0 as a grade. So please guys pick a question I'm ok with any one from what already suggested or any other suggestion 

## 

Kyler Suess

2/14/24, 5:29 PM

Chadia, I agree with you. I did not realize we had to pick a question by then or zero grade. Out of the four questions you provided, I like "What are the long-term effects of drug use on consciousness and cognitive function" and "How do different drugs impact consciousness differently"

  

We are just waiting for Egypt and Grace to give their input so we can make a decision.

##

I didn't realize the we need to pick a question by Sunday either. Out of the four questions, I like "What are the long-term effects of drug use on consciousness and cognitive function. Sorry for getting back to you guys so late, I'm dual enrolled and I'm a cheerleader so I only really have my scheduled time at 12.

Hello everyone 

I also like "What are the long-term effects of drug use on consciousness and cognitive function.

## 

Egypt Davis-Witcher

2/15/24, 2:13 PM

I like the topic "How do different drugs impact consciousness differently " 

## 

Egypt Davis-Witcher

2/15/24, 2:16 PM

But. it seems everyone likes "What are the long term effects of drug use on consciousness and cognitive function" so I am fine with use using this as a group topic.

## 

Kyler Suess

2/16/24, 8:02 AM

Hey, we got a fifth member, welcome to the group, Nasrat!

  

Let's start looking at articles about the inquiry question "What are the long-term effects of drug use on consciousness and cognitive function," and see what we find. If we don't find many good articles related to that question, we can try looking for articles about how different drugs impact consciousness differently.

  

Once we find our five articles, writing this should be easy.

2/16/24, 12:27 PM

Ok great , I will do some research and reply by 5pm today

## 

Grace Conley

2/18/24, 12:29 PM

Hey guys, I've found a few articles should I send them in here?

## 

Grace Conley

2/18/24, 12:29 PM

Also, should we create like a shared Google doc or something we can all type in?

## 

Kyler Suess

Hey, everyone! A bit of a lengthy post here, just want to make sure we are all on the same page.

  

Started to look into some articles related to our chosen question and read the example projects. I would suggest reading the example projects, as you will notice they have many inquiry questions. I have also been looking over the requirements for this paper. Starting with the paper requirements, it follows a basic outline of the following:

  

1. Introduction of Project Topic
2. Body of Your Project:
3. Major Theme Number One
4. Major Theme Number Two
5. Major Theme Number Three, etc.
6. Conclusion
7. Reference Page in [APA format](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html)

I also looked over how we are supposed to choose our articles (I have never written a psychology paper before), and decided to see what I could find from the Schoolcraft Library. It takes you to the following website https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/search/advanced?vid=0&sid=c0970a42-630b-4440-afb1-c5fad91bb7e9%40redis

Note: Only **THREE** of our FIVE articles can come from the following link. The Project Expectations also mention the articles we choose must be ones where the study and article writing were done by the same person. From the teacher's project explanation: 

1. As stated, you will need to find a total of five **_PRIMARY RESEARCH_** articles related to the team’s psychology topic of inquiry. Read the abstracts and skim the articles to determine if they correspond well to your topic AND inquiry question. Note that by **_PRIMARY RESEARCH_** these must be articles that **_describe a Research Study_** conducted by the authors. This may NOT be an article that summarizes the research by others. A quick guideline is to look for articles that have “research methods” and “analyses” within the paper. If you do NOT see current data collection and analyses by the author, then this is not a primary source for this assignment. Here is an [example of a primary research article](https://bbaddins.schoolcraft.edu/addins/psych201v3/docs/primary.pdf).

With all of that said, I found two articles that might match the criteria, I have emailed the teacher for some clarification on what articles are valid (still reading them but wanted to share this information). See the links

https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&sid=afa4cde8-253c-4ed4-aacd-362482f5d668%40redis&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=2011-27123-001&db=pdh

https://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=5&sid=6edaac2f-3603-44c1-8435-92794645c217%40redis&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=pdh&AN=2024-36275-001

  

I would like for us to start figuring out an outline and what themes we want to cover. Based on our question, we aren't limited in what our themes could be. For example, our themes could be covering multiple drugs and what they do, or we could have a theme covering how these few drugs affect the brain similarly. Maybe a theme comparing the long-term use from childhood versus adulthood (like the article I provided about marijuana from an early age). We could have a theme about the benefits of long-term drug use, and another about the downsides of long-term drug use. We can even have a theme built off of the question "How do different drugs impact consciousness differently," we could instead say "How do different drugs impact consciousness differently over the long?". In the last two sentences, those are three themes right there. There are a few different categories drugs are thrown into, see this website for some ideas https://www.theiacp.org/7-drug-categories

  

What I would focus on:

- Remembering we only have five total articles, since we have five group members we each only need to submit one. That also goes for how much you need to write. While you are only submitting one article, you do need to read all five.
- What kind of drug do you have questions about, and how can it be tied to our inquiry question.
- Our inquiry is broad, so we aren't limited in what we are writing about.
- Finding at least one article that fits the criteria from the teacher and relates to our question.

  

Once, I get more information on the type of articles the teacher is looking for, I will let you all know along with an example that does match! Hopefully, this helps everyone, I don't mean to make this seem more complicated than it is. I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page so we are working together! Let me know what you all think and where you want to take this paper. I am going to start adding a little to a collaborative Word document ([Course Project PSYCH201.docx](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AlmaW3GH8vGiazVaSXsyZbIym5I?e=iDEWEA)). Let me know if that link works for you all. If not, let me know, and post your suggestions here in the meantime.

Hi everyone, this are the articals I could get if you all can browse it and give your opinions about if it will help build our project.

Hello everyone sorry for not responding, i was in hospital didn't feel good, can you guys tell me where we been do we still looking for articles? 

## 

Kyler Suess

11 hours ago, at 9:03 AM

Chadia, those seem to be articles that summarize research by others (see the assignment expectations), the last article **Risk and protective factors of drug abuse among adolescents: a systematic review,** might work. I was having trouble finding articles that are specifically research studies done by the author(s) with conclusions from the author(s). If you think I am wrong on this, do correct me, I have never written a psychology paper so I could be misinterpreting the instructions. I did email the teacher asking for clarification on what kind of articles she is looking for.

  

Nasrat, sorry to hear that. No need to apologize, health is more important than school. We are still looking for articles, I would read the assignment expectations to get an idea of what it is we need to do. I also wrote out what I think we should be doing a few messages above.

Hi Kyler I think that the articles are only to give an idea and understand the topic that we want to write about after setting the basics that we will follow in writing the topic, and the rest will be our efforts in building the topic.

Also, have we been using the wrong chat? I was looking over the "How I will be graded" section in blackboard, and noticed there is a "My Group" message area. Chadia was the only one to send a message in there. What do you all think?

As for the articles, that makes more sense to me. I had a lot of difficulties finding articles that were not some kind of meta-analysis.
