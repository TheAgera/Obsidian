## Module 8 Normal Distribution

Weâ€™ll be looking at the following calculations:

- Probability of being less than a value in a normally distributed population.
- Probability of being more than a value in a normally distributed population.
- Probability of being between two values in a normally distributed population.
- Cut-off value such that a certain percentage of values would be below that value in a normally distributed population.
- Cut-off value such that a certain percentage of values would be above that value in a normally distributed population.

Normal Distribution is the backbone to many satistics work, and most large variables will take on this characteristics, especially the mean.
